# HETHOD: A Brief Guide to Machine Learning for Beginners
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence focused on building applications that learn from data and improve their accuracy over time without being programmed to do so. In recent years, it has been an uprising technique in computer science.

A machine learning beginner is a programmer with an interest who may have started to know the concept of it.But they need a more gentle introduction away from code, textbooks and courses. They need the main idea pointed out first to lay the foundation for novice-level material.

HETHOD is a method to build up the system of machine learning in a processive manner.
